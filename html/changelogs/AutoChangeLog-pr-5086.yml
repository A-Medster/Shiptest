changes:
  - {balance: Prevents most automatic guns from mounting scopes (along with a 
      few more like the E50 and Accelerator laser cannon)}
  - {balance: 'Locks the long scope to the Illestren, lever-actions, and Beacon'}
  - {balance: Decreased medium scope zoom to give you only about 4 tiles of 
      extra visibility}
  - {balance: Hydra DMR can no longer mount extended or casket mags}
delete-after: true
